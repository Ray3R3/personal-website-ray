        The disruption narrative is Silicon Valley's founding mythology, but like most mythologies, it obscures more than it reveals. The story goes: scrappy startups with better technology overthrow entrenched incumbents who were too slow to adapt. David beats Goliath. Innovation triumphs over inertia.
      </p>

      <p>
        This narrative is compelling because it casts entrepreneurs as heroes and frames technological change as a moral drama. But it's incomplete at best, misleading at worst. Most successful "disruptors" don't overthrow existing systems—they evolve within them, often with the tacit cooperation of incumbents.

      <h2>Evolution, Not Revolution</h2>

      <p>
        Consider the rise of fintech. Companies like Stripe, Square, and Plaid didn't disrupt traditional financial infrastructure—they <strong>interfaced with it</strong>. They built elegant APIs on top of the same ACH rails, card networks, and banking regulations that incumbents use. The innovation was in the interface, not the underlying system.
      </p>

      <p>
        This pattern repeats across industries. Uber didn't invent ride-sharing—taxis existed. It created a better dispatch and payment system. Airbnb didn't invent short-term rentals—hotels and bed-and-breakfasts existed. It created a better discovery and booking platform. The "disruption" was really interface innovation.
      </p>

      <h2>The Institutional Layer</h2>

      <p>
        What the disruption narrative misses is the role of institutional change. New technologies don't succeed in a vacuum—they succeed when institutions are ready to adopt them. This readiness often depends on regulatory changes, cultural shifts, and economic pressures that have little to do with the technology itself.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        The most successful "disruptors" are those who understand that technological change and institutional change are deeply intertwined.

      <h2>Symbiosis Over Substitution</h2>

      <p>
        The reality is that most technological change happens through symbiosis, not substitution. New systems integrate with existing ones, creating hybrid arrangements that gradually shift power and capability. This is messier than the disruption narrative suggests, but it's how change actually happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding this has practical implications. If you're building in a regulated industry, your success depends less on technical superiority than on institutional navigation. The question isn't whether your technology is better—it's whether institutions are ready to adopt it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mythology of disruption persists because it's useful for entrepreneurs seeking funding and investors seeking returns. But building successful companies requires understanding the mundane realities of institutional change, not just the heroic narratives of technological revolution.
